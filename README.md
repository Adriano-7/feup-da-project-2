# Algorithms design project - Routing Algorithm for Ocean Shipping and Urban Deliveries

## Project Goals
<div>
    The project aims to address the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
    Since the TSP is an NP-hard problem, the project focuses on designing efficient algorithms that employ heuristics to approximate optimal solutions. 
    The heuristics will be customized based on the input data, and the project will analyze the trade-offs between optimality and efficiency of the developed algorithms. 
    Additionally, the project involves implementing a backtracking algorithm to obtain optimal solutions for small graphs, which will serve as a benchmark for evaluating the heuristics' performance. <br><br>
